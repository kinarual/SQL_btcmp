Please download a script with Database Model (rush01_model.sql) and apply the script to your database. Anomalies in source tables are intentional for training purposes. All tables in the DWH inherit all anomalies from the source tables (Tables are not in data consistency + Possible NULL values for Name and Lastname in the User table and etc.)
